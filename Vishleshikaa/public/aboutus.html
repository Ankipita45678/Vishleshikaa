      <p><strong>Dear Students and Researchers,</strong></p>

      </p><br>
      <p>
        Vishleshikaa represents a significant milestone in our efforts to foster a culture of research and innovation among students. This platform will provide a unique opportunity for young minds to share their ideas, collaborate with peers, and learn from experts in the industry.
      </p>
      <p>
        As students, you are the driving force behind Vishleshikaa. Your curiosity, creativity, and passion for research will shape the future of analytics. I encourage you to embrace this opportunity with enthusiasm and dedication.
      </p>
      <p>Through Vishleshikaa, I urge you to:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Explore new ideas and perspectives</li>
        <li>Develop your critical thinking and problem-solving skills</li>
        <li>Collaborate with peers from diverse backgrounds</li>
        <li>Learn from experts and industry leaders</li>

        <li>Create products and services to solve problems.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Remember, research is a journey, not a destination. It's about asking questions, seeking answers, and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.
      </p><br>
      <p>
        I am confident that Vishleshikaa will become a catalyst for inspiring future generations of researchers and analysts. I look forward to witnessing the incredible work that will be showcased.

        Analytics Global Conference 2025 (AGC2025) is the third conference of the AGC series. The theme for AGC2025 is Human-centered Data Analytics: Technology for Sustainable Development. The conference aims to promote industryacademia collaboration for analytics. It is my pleasure to see the enthusiasm it has generated among the scholars and professionals and the large  number of papers submitted for the conference. Analytics Global Conference offers students, scholars, and faculty members a great opportunity to present and publish highquality research work. We hope to see a significant increase in the quantity and quality of submissions over the years.
      </p><br>
     <p>
        This year we are starting our very own Computing & Analytics journal named “Vishleshikaa”. The name Vishleshikaa is derived from the Sanskrit word Vishleshan ( िव े षण), which means analysis. The journal aims to nurture students’ interests, promote knowledge, and inculcate ideation abilities for an improved learning experience. The journal aims to be a cornerstone for promoting culture of using Computing technology and Analytics for societal good and economic growth. 
     </p><br>
     <p>
         The first edition of Vishleshikaa showcases ebullient efforts by students in making a scholarly contribution. It serves as evidence of the analytical power of young minds and their endeavour to go beyond the curriculum to garner knowledge. The editorial team extends whole-hearted encouragement to all authors of Vishleshikaa and wishes them the very best in their future endeavours. 
     </p><br>
     <p>
        As artificial intelligence is becoming a mainstay of our daily lives, the domain of data science, machine learning, deep learning, and their applications will gain increasing importance. Analytics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence will continue to change lives and lifestyles. There is an immense need for quality research and innovation in this field. Vishleshikaa is an effort to usher in an ecosystem of research and innovation for higher learning.
